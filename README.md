# Hytale Voice Chat

A proximity voice chat mod which only needs a browser page to be kept open in the background.

I built this for while we wait for hytale to add native voice chat support.

## What will happen when Hytale adds their own voice chat?
Once they have added native voice chat support, I will take a look and see if there are any ways to enhance it in any way and replace this mod.

Though this was more of an experiment to test the waters making a server side mod. Feel free to join my discord if you have any feedback, suggestions or want to chat about Hytale modding in general!

## Setup
TODO need to write a guide on how to set up a valid ssl certificate for https to be secure for server owners. For now the mod will use self signed certs which will bring up a warning.
